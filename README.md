# GOV.UK Frontend Webpack Demo

This repo demonstrates how to use Webpack to compile the minimum amount of CSS and JS needed to render a basic GOV.UK page.

## Get started

```shell
git clone https://github.com/matthew-shaw/govuk-webpack.git
cd govuk-webpack
npm install
```

## Build assets

Output bundled CSS, JS, fonts and images to `./dist`:

```shell
npm run build
```

## Watch changes

Rebuild assets automatically when changed:

```shell
npm run watch
```

## Run dev server

Start a rudimentary web server with live reloading:

```shell
npm start
```
